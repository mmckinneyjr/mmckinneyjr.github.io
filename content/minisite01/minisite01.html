      Pocket Menu is an application users can use to store information about their favorite food dishes when they go
      out. A user logs into the main screen where they then see a location screen each time the app is opened. From this
      screen they select the location of the restaurant they want to view their menu and the restaurants menu of. The
      current location they selected is then displayed at the top of the screen until changed. The first screen displays
      the users personal menu created at that location. They also have the option to view the restaurants entire menu
      where they can add new items to their menu as well as rate and/or like or dislike a dish. They have options for
      adding their own photos. There is a search bar which allows them to search a food style or the name of dish from
      their personal menu or the restaurants menu depending on which screen they are in. In addition there is a side
      drawer with a few more options. From here users can follow friends menus for inspiration as well as see over all
      rating for each dish. Also in the side drawer is another way of changing location, settings, and account info.

    <div class="text">
      The purpose of the style boards is to capture the look and feel of the over all app. The design is meant to
      capture a warm homey feel that can suit any style food dish. The color choices are natural which allow the vibrant
      images of the dishes to pop on screen and look more appealing. I think coming up with color schemes can be one of
      the first challenges in designing anything. The colors really set the tone for a design and influence the form of
      of it, such as the icons, textures, layout and more.

      Low fidelity artboards, though rough and little detail help to lay out the overall design and functionality. This
      is where the app gets its shell.

      Many revisions were made before finalizing these preview screens. One of the biggest challenges is screen size. As
      an example, a struggle was with the text size for the watch version. When designing on a computer screen it is
      much larger and a design may look perfect until you shrink it down to its actual scale, the type then maybe be
      illegible or too difficult to read. Over all it was a fun project, getting feedback from others helped a lot in
      refining and tweaking small design weaknesses.

              Testing has been going on throughout all phases from concept to high renderings. However here you see
              examples of users testing a prototype of the application. The colored heat spots indicate where users
              tapped after being asked to perform a specific task. I am pleased to say the major hot spots are where
              they should be. There were other test performed as well which indicated some need for tweaking. In
              addition in person questionnaires were completed by users with added another element of critiques. Testing
              is a critical part of the design process since at the end of the day it is the users who will being using
              your application and it they who needs to be happy. Users find it too difficult or have a bad UX they will
              quit the app and use another one.
